================ Abstract
This paper was written as part of the Module Research Methods for Information Systems at the University of Applied Sciences and Arts Northwestern Switzerland.
Tuberculosis (TB) is a respiratory disease and is often referred to as the "great mimicker", as it can easily be mistaken for other illnesses. TB remains a significant global health challenge, with millions of cases and a substantial number of deaths each year. In this context, AI tools, particularly large language models, show promising results in supporting doctors during the initial diagnostic phase.
This paper aimed to explore the effectiveness of infusing ChatGPT with specific academic knowledge about TB to generate precise diagnostic questions. The study aimed to determine whether such a tool could improve the diagnostic accuracy of inexperienced medicine practitioners to a level comparable with that of specialized doctors. Using LangChain, an open-source RAG framework, GPT 4o was embedded with documents having the expectation of generating a precise set of diagnostic questions based on a predefined prompt.
As a result, we found that while the generated questionnaire contained relevant questions, it could not fully match the expertise of an experienced doctor. However, the evaluation of the questionnaire only involved a limited number of experts. Furthermore, the created artifact offers numerous parameters and multiple extensions. Therefore, it has a high potential to be further experimented.
